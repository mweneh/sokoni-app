# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#Sokoni App

An app that allows you to view  and buy items in our store using various categories listed.


## Description

This project basically covers most parts of React JS including routing and hooks. Keep in mind no database was configured on this application and data is lost the moment you reload the application.


## Specifications


## Prerequisites

-Knowedge of JavaScript and React JS including react hooks.
## Technologies Used 

- React JS
- Redux
- Font-awesome
- CSS (Bootstrap)



## Setup Installations Requirements
   * To run the application, in your terminal:

    1. Clone or download the Repository
    2. cd into directory then run `cd sokoni'
    4. Open terminal command line then navigate to the root folder of the application.
    5. Run `npm start` command.
    6. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.
  

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

To fix a bug or enhance an existing module, follow these steps:

- Fork the repo
- Create a new branch (`git checkout -b improve-feature`)
- Make the appropriate changes in the files
- Add changes to reflect the changes made
- Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Improve feature'`)
- Push to the branch (`git push origin improve-feature`)
- Create a Pull Request 





## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
